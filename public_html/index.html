            Hello! My name is Will, and I am a Cyber Security major minoring in Software Engineering, at Drexel University. I am a brother of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. Throughout my life, my interest in technology has driven me towards a profession in cybersecurity and software development. My dream is to one day start my own tech firm to revolutionize and set the bar in the industry using my passions and skills particularly in cryptocurrency. This site is a statement to my professional journey, as I begin the rest of my life, continuing to expand my knowledge and skills, while staying up to date with current technological advances and exploring new ideas to contribute to the field. My journey is not only about bettering myself and achieving the standard of personal success, but also involves making a considerable contribution to society with technology.        <h4>Connect with Me!</h4>
